  <p>
    Hack Michiana is an opportunity for individuals to be engaged citizens and take an active role in our community. We need engineers, technologists, civil servants, community builders, scientists, designers, artists, educators, students, entrepreneurs, project managers (are you reading all people, all skills? that's what's needed) - anybody who is willing to collaborate with others to create, build, and invent to solve challenges relevant to our neighborhoods and our community. There are so many advantages for a community that has these community building events, such as creating space for innovation and spurring economic opportunity. Not to mention, you could increase your personal network and perhaps learn a new skill. Join us for this chance for our community to get inspired and get involved. Join us to hack for change and help reboot citizenship.

    <p>
        <strong>I hear about "hackers" in the news. Isn't hacking bad?</strong> - To us,
        a hacker is someone who uses a minimum of resources and a maximum of brainpower
        and ingenuity to create, enhance or fix something. Although in some circumstances
        it is used in a negative sense, the term is not inherently negative, nor does it
        even have to be related to technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Who can participate in Hack Michiana?</strong> - Anyone can participate
        in any National Day of Civic Hacking event, throughout the country. To have a successful
