    <p>
        <strong>I hear about "hackers" in the news. Isn't hacking bad?</strong> - To us,
        a hacker is someone who uses a minimum of resources and a maximum of brainpower
        and ingenuity to create, enhance or fix something. Although in some circumstances
        it is used in a negative sense, the term is not inherently negative, nor does it
        even have to be related to technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Who can participate in Hack Michiana?</strong> - Anyone can participate
        in any National Day of Civic Hacking event, throughout the country. To have a successful
        event, we are going to need people from all backgrounds, with a broad range of skills.
        We'll need engineers, technologists, scientists, designers, artists, educators,
        students, entrepreneurs -- anyone who has a passion for changing their community
